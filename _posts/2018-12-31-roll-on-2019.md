2018 is nearly at an end. In fact, as I was typing that sentence, I received a push notification from a breaking news app that Sydney was celebrating New Year. Exactly _why_ that is breaking news is a question for another day.

For me, 2018 has been one hell of a year for both family, work, and personal development.

* **Family:** I've now got a son as well as my daughter. One of each, feeling very lucky. New car, house completely redone exactly how we want it
* **Work:** Senior in all but pay check :moneybag: I'm doing a lot more at the beginning of projects rather than just being _the ops guy_
* **Personal Development:** I've been writing Node and Go this year. I actually rather enjoy it. It's certainly where a portion of my time is going to be spent next year too.

Which leads me on to the point of this post, what do I want to achieve next year? There are a couple of things in the above categories, so I'll just go ahead and list them out

1. RHEL and AWS qualifications
1. Write more code
1. Blog more (possibly even about #2)
1. Stop biting my nails
1. Get trim (not fat) and stay trimmed (tame the beard daily)
1. Go out walking more with the family
1. Do more talks about devops things

So there you go. Not looking forward to 2019-12-31 when I look back on this post and realise I've done nothing...

Happy new year! :tada:
