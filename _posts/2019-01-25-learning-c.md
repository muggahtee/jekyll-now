I was going to come up with a witty title for this blog post, but my brain is fried from everything that's been injected into it.

I'm obsessed will being T-shaped (or maybe even **Ï€** or **comb** shaped). For those of you that don't know, [here's a wiki page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-shaped_skills) on the matter, but essentially it's a way to describe your abilities, particularly within the workplace.

```
B  R  O  A  D

      -

      D

      E

      E

      P
```

You see the idea, with pi-shaped having two "deep" vertical bars (or specialisms), and comb-shaped having many more.

**Anyway**, I've been playing around with Go and NodeJS, but thought I would try hand had at something a little more pure. We get one day per fortnight at work to do learning, research, personal development sort of things, and so I decided that I would start looking at C.

I fired up online course after online course and just got frustrated with how fucking boring they all were. So I made the decision to just write something and figure out how it all works.

The idea that I came up with was an application that will take a word, look at each letter, get an integer based on its position in the alphabet, and sum them all together to give a total word score.

```
$ ./wordcalc hello
52
```

The fact that I am writing this and not still banging my head on the desk should give you an indication that I managed it, so [here](https://git.sr.ht/~ols/wordcalc) is the code, which includes a little test script, and [here](https://builds.sr.ht/~ols/job/23973) is the successful build and test.

Shout out to [sr.ht](https://meta.sr.ht/) which is an amazing hosted open source software suite, though you can run it yourself if you like.

So yes, lesson one went well. Here's to many more!
